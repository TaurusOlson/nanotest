Motivation
==========

I want a quick way of testing my code. Testing should be easy and fun. It
shouldn't get in your way.  Actually I think it should almost be as natural as
coding your main project.
There are many frameworks so why write another one?

Here are a few reasons:

* [unittest](http://docs.python.org/library/unittest.html) is great but I find
  it long to setup. Most of the time, its rigidity frustrates me and I end up
  skipping the testing phase!

* I want to have fun with tests in Python and have fun creating my own unit
  testing framework.
